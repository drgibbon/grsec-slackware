# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

kernel-grsec: This is a Linux kernel with built-in support for most disk
kernel-grsec: controllers.  To use filesystems, or to load support for a SCSI or
kernel-grsec: other controller, then you'll need to load one or more kernel
kernel-grsec: modules using an initial ramdisk, or initrd.  For more information
kernel-grsec: about creating an initrd, see the README.initrd file in the /boot
kernel-grsec: directory.
